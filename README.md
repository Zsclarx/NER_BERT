# NER with BERT

This project demonstrates how to use a fine-tuned BERT model for Named Entity Recognition (NER) using Streamlit for a simple web-based interface.

## Overview

This application allows users to input text and receive NER predictions from a BERT model. The BERT model is pre-trained and fine-tuned on the CoNLL dataset for NER tasks.
